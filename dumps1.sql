Normally, when bees winter over, about 5-10% die.  But starting in 2005, numbers sky rocketed up to 30% and some beekeepers are losing 50%.  So why should you care?  ¼ of the American diet relies upon pollinating done by bees.  Without them, we wouldn’t have apples, almonds or many other foods.\r\n \r\n Some blame the Varroa beemite that have become resistant to pesticide.\r\n \r\n Some blame a new kind of pesticide called Neonicotinoids – they are made from tobacco and become infused in the plant releasing small amounts of poison over a long period of time.  These small levels appear to be not toxic to bees, but it’s possible that their damage is cumulative over time. The massive die offs, and the popularization of Neonicotinoids happened around the same time.\r\n \r\n Still others blame a combination of the above and the soup of other chemicals, herbicides, and other things that bees run into on farms.  Each of the chemicals alone may be ok, but when you combine them, they claim, it becomes a recipe for disaster.\r\n \r\n Unrelated to the above, wild bees are in decline because the massive farms that grow only one crop all flower at once, while the rest of the year there is nothing for the bees to feed on for miles around.  In nature, different species of plants are staggered in their blooming so bees can feed for a really long time instead of feast and famine.  Farms now must rely heavily upon hiring bee keepers who truck their hives in for the flowering of a particular crop and then truck the bees to another farm for a different crop.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(3,'Company Cut-Backs','Right now, many companies cut back on their employees’ hours so they are not considered full time and therefore don’t have to pay them benefits.

We now add over 70 million people to the already highly populated Earth every single year.  This stretches the world’s natural resources.   Eventually, we will pass the world’s ability to support this many people.  Certainly, we have already passed the ability for the world to support the number of people we have if everyone were to live with the same quality of life as Americans unless there is a dramatic shift in technology.\r\n Between the cost of public school and foster care, an unwanted child costs the taxpayers over $30,000/year.   By the time that kid has graduated high school, this totals over $390,000.  Compare this with the cost of supplying a condom a day for the same period – less than $1,000.  If the kid is raised poorly and goes into the criminal system, their cost could go up to $60,000 per year for incarcerating him.  That could bring his total lifetime cost to taxpayers at over four million dollars. \r\n On the other hand, you never know when a baby might turn out to be the next Einstein or Leonardo DaVinci.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(5,'Carbon Cap and Trade','Carbon Dioxide is a greenhouse gas.  The more fuel we burn, the more carbon dioxide escapes into the atmosphere.  Over years this traps the sun’s heat and causes our weather patterns to be more energetic causing destructive storms, raises the temperatures in other areas where parasitic bugs that normally die off seasonally end up living year round and destroy crops, and other areas flood.  These are just a few of the problems created by carbon dioxide.  Historically, there has been no cost associated with creating these gasses, and no responsibility for the homes destroyed by storms, lost crops, etc..  Carbon cap and trade is a two part system where industries are allowed to produce only a certain amount of carbon dioxide.  If a company produces less carbon dioxide than their maximum limit, they can sell their unused carbon credits to other companies that produced more carbon than they were allowed to.  Companies that capture carbon dioxide (planting trees, pumping CO2 underground…) create carbon credits that they can sell also.  This system is meant to make capitalism work in favor of a better environment.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(6,'Child Rearing','Raising great children means raising a great society.

But if they couldn’t prove it, then the material would be sold at auction and the money would be used by the authorities for whatever they wanted.   This was originally designed to make it prohibitively expensive for criminals to run illegal businesses.  If a drug dealer was transporting drugs in a private airplane, the authorities could take the plane.  If he was dealing out of his house, they could take his house.  The use has been spread to cover a wider variety of criminals and lower level suspects.

They are things that allow us to be individuals and not be oppressed.  Protecting these rights for all often means protecting the right of people we disagree with to do things we dislike.  For example, freedom of speech allows people to spread hate mongering.  Sometimes civil liberties come into conflict with public safety.

Some of this spending will go towards goods and services provided by people in the community.  This supplies jobs and the economy grows. When the public feels fear and pessimism, the opposite happens.  Consumer confidence can be influenced by how things are going at work, how things are going at home, the amount of money in their bank accounts, how politicians and reporters talk about the future, the weather, the physical appearance of their surroundings,  or even what films and TV shows are popular.\r\n There are a number of things that politicians use to try to jump start consumer confidence.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(14,'Crime Prevention','It’s often much cheaper in direct expenditures, in reduced human suffering, and in lost economic activity to prevent a crime rather than to capture, prosecute and punish criminals.

No single source is right for the entire United States and in fact no single source alone is right for any region. Many regions would be best suited to have an environmentally friendly source to produce much of the power and another source to produce for peak demand only.  Energy cannot be transmitted far without loss, so the idea of having one super huge source of energy in the middle of nowhere is not very practical.  See a quick comparison of the different sources HERE.\n \n QUICK COMPARISON \n \n \n \n Solar is always improving but is still currently more expensive than coal or even oil (if you don’t take into consideration tax benefits and other government expenditures on these industries). Solar produces more energy depending upon the quantity of sunlight. This doesn’t necessarily coincide with customer need. So you need to either have a second fuel source like oil that can be used to supplement it in times when the solar plant isn’t supplying the full need of the customers - or you need to make the solar power plant much larger and find a way of storing the excess energy for times of need. These currently require a lot of space and sun, so building these in the Pacific North-West and Northern East Coast would not be an economical choice with current technology. \n \n Wind energy, has the same pitfalls as Solar except instead of requiring light, it requires wind. So it is best placed in regions with lots of wind. Daily wind supplies change and many locations will have some seasons windier than others. Long term effects of wide spread use is unknown. Some fear accidental deaths of migrating birds and others fear affecting the wind currents. Turbines have been redesigned to reduce bird hits and many think the idea of affecting wind currents on a wide scale is highly unlikely, but dams were thought to have no effect on the environment either until they were put up all over.  They should not be put up near where people live because the constant noise, ice thrown off the blades, low frequency rumble and flickering shadows can create both physical and psychological damage.\n \n Dams - have been shown to be a really inexpensive source of electricity but have also been a bit of a disaster for the fishing industry and much of the environment. Areas appropriate for damming that haven’t already been dammed are few and far between. Power generation is flexible to meet changing hourly demand.\n \n Other hydro-electric energy - these are underwater propellers, anchored floating pontoons, or dammed bays that take advantage of the river current, wave action, or daily changing tide. With the exception of storm surges, these sources are very predictable. You have to have just the right geography and other conditions to make these work and not be a hindrance to shipping or prove to be high maintenance because of underwater debris. But if you do have the right conditions, they can prove to be economical, environmentally friendly, and often a source that can produce electricity close to many of our older major cities. Many of these sources produce different quantities of energy at different times of the day so they are not flexible to meet hourly demands unless you build it to produce more than you need. Dammed bays, for example, produce a lot of energy when the tide is coming in or going out, but nothing in between. Unknown effect on aquatic life.  Depending on the technology, it could improve some environmental problems while hurting others.\n \n Geothermal - is really inexpensive but only available in very few areas of the United States. Power generation is flexible to meet changing hourly demand.\n \n Nuclear - There is not enough fuel in the world to meet the world’s demands but it can be used to as one piece in the pie. Accidents can prove dangerous to wide areas. Some pollutants have to be stored for hundreds of years or longer before they are safe. Transportation and storage of this waste is both a hazard and security risk. Storage facilities capable of keeping these wastes safe are few and far between. If you don’t take into consideration long term storage and accident clean-up, then nuclear is one of the cheapest sources of energy (after dams and geothermal). Power generation is flexible to meet changing hourly demand.\n \n Coal is another cheap source of power. Over 50% of American electricity is produced with coal. Burning coal produces greenhouse gasses, acid rain, ammonia, heavy metals and other toxins. The toxicity of coal depends upon what it is made of (where it is mined) and the techniques used to burn it. Some of these techniques allow more complete burning. Other techniques capture the toxins so they can be buried instead of released into the air. It’s still really toxic and a lot of people die from mining every year. Mining practices also tend to be destructive to the environment but some methods are better than others. The term \"clean coal\" refers to technologies that are not as dirty as previous technologies but are still dirty. Power generation is flexible to meet changing hourly demand and domestic supply is plentiful.\n Gas is more expensive than coal and cannot be acquired for a reasonable price without polluting a dwindling supply of fresh water. There is some risk that the process of drilling for gas may also pollute local drinking water supplies and creates some ground seepage. (some believe that decades of seepage has created some minor earth quakes) Once processed, burning gas creates greenhouse gasses but otherwise is pretty clean. Power generation is flexible to meet changing hourly demands and domestic supply is plentiful.\n \n Oil is also more expensive than coal but is currently very close in price to natural gas. Drilling for it does have some environmental risks but most drilling does not pollute as much as some other mining. Burning oil produces greenhouse gasses and other pollutants Like gas and coal, some of the toxins vary based upon the region it was drilled in. Global demand for oil is increasing and global supply of oil is dwindling so this resource is likely to go up in price in the future. Power generation is flexible to meet changing hourly demands.\n \n Biofuels - biofuel is created by a chemical process that breaks down plant material. They are currently too expensive for power production, but are commonly used in vehicles. The most common one in America is corn based ethanol. Using products that can actually feed people turns out to not be a good idea, but there are other products that can be turned into biofuels.

Prices were expensive and people starved.  Now we live in a land of plenty, but that same technology that saved so many lives, has had some detrimental effects on the environment as well.\r\n \r\n Overuse of fertilizers cause the run off from the fields to oversaturate the rivers with nutrients. This causes algae to grow out of control.  Unlike other plant life, some algae take oxygen out of the water and emit toxins.  The fish and other animals in the water suffocate and die.

They can spend their allowance all in one day or spread it out.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(24,'Fracking','Traditional drilling works great in places where large pockets of oil or gas exist under ground. You drill down to the pocket and the pressure of all the earth above squirts the fuel up.  But in places with many small pockets, if you drill down, you only get access to a tiny bit of fuel. Sort of like popping one bubble in a whole sheet of bubble wrap.  Imagine trying to use a long pin to try to puncture all the bubbles in a sheet of bubble wrap that was buried under a mattress.  It would be REALLY hard.  A newer, more expensive form of traditional drilling, allows the drill to turn and go horizontally, which allows you to drill down to the basic layer and then poke around left and right.  With fracking, what they do is drill a hole down to the first pocket and then inject high pressure fluids to break down the walls between one bubble and the next.  It’s like rolling over the bubble wrap in your car. Once the rocks are fractured, they inject other fluids and gravel to keep the cracks open and let the fuel flow out. Currently, the fluid used to apply the pressure is water mixed with a lot of chemicals that prevent the fuel from getting tainted by forcibly mixing it with water.  Fracking makes it a lot cheaper to drill for oil and gas in places that would otherwise be not worth drilling. \r\n The chemicals used in this process are a trade secret.  Many of them are toxic but because they are trade secrets, we don’t know what they are.

This seems like a good idea on the surface, however in order to get a proper ID, someone would have to take off from work to go a far distance to wait in line and potentially pay fees.  Many of us already did that to get our driver’s license, so we don’t have to do it again.  But for people who live in cities that don’t need driver’s licenses, the elderly who’ve lost theirs, and the poor who can’t afford a car, they need to take those extra steps in order to vote.  This, in effect, is making it harder for the poor, the elderly, and those living in big cities to vote.  Many believe that this is the true reason why some people in power are pressing for this change.  In fact, many Republican leaders have said outright that this is their personal reason why they are pressing the law because it would affect more Democrats than Republicans. The fact that out of 197 million votes cast between 2002 and 2005, only 40 were proven to be cast by people pretending to be someone else, might indicate that this is not a big problem.  On the other hand, some would claim that the only reason so few people were caught is because the forms of ID currently required are so easy to fake (in most cases, just signatures.) \n Voter ID’s would not do anything towards catching voter fraud in other areas that appear to be more prevalent.  Nor would it fix out of date voter registration databases that include people who have died or moved to other states.  These database can be used in other forms of fraud.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(32,'Illegal Immigration','Right now, illegal immigrants pose a threat to themselves and society simply because they are illegal.  Because of their fear of being deported, they can fall victim to unsafe work and living conditions and are less likely to report a crime or dangerous situation.  These dangerous situations (such as fire hazards or unclean food processing) may affect regular American citizens.  The current design of border fences can be easily and permanently breached in less than 3 minutes. (Or you can hop it in a few seconds with a ladder) Building these fences for the 2,000 mile border between Mexico and the US and the 5,500 mile border between the US and Canada would be extremely expensive and would still leave open the 12,500 miles of coastline we have.

They merely enforce them – including the laws they don’t like.   But in order to enforce them, they must first interpret them, and there are many different ways of interpreting the same law.  Three common ways are:\r\n The Spirit of the Law – What the law was originally intended to do.\r\n The Letter of the Law -What the written law actually says.\r\n Legal Precedent – How the law has been interpreted by others in the past.\r\n And less common:\r\n \r\n Current Social Need – the repurposing or reinterpretation of a law to meet current needs – for example using anti-racketeering laws to fight terrorists.\r\n \r\n For example: The voters ask for a law to prevent people from running car repair businesses from the front of their homes making a mess of the street.  So the politicians write a law saying “Car repairs in parking spaces are not allowed.”  Following the letter of the law, a guy running a business out of his house can pull the cars onto his front lawn while a regular citizen is not allowed to change his flat tire if he’s parked in the street.\r\n  \r\n Most of the time, when someone breaks the law, a judge relies mostly on Legal Precedent. But if the way the law was broken is really unusual, or if this is the first time the law was broken, then they have to look at the other criteria carefully.\r\n \r\n A judge has to decide on a case-by-case basis what to do.  Does he stay true to the letter of the law forcing politicians to write better laws?  Does he go by the spirit of the law?  If so, how does he know what the original intent was?  If there have been judges deciding the same way on the law for decades, then he has that as a guide.  If not, then he has to use other sources.  A judge is allowed to go against precedent, but it is rare that he will do so, partly because predictability of the law makes prosecution of it easier and partly because there is a possibility that his ruling may be overturned by a higher court.  If a judge’s cases are constantly being overturned, then he may be seen as ineffectual, incompetent and may even be fired.  However, as the world and society changes, so do the interpretations of the laws sometimes. \r\n \r\n The lowest of court judges may choose to disagree with the way even the US Supreme Court interprets a law, and if a similar court case comes across his bench, he may choose to go in a different direction.  (But their ruling may get thrown out).   Judges who constantly value their own interpretation over previous interpretations have recently been labeled “Activist judges”.  Is this a good thing or a bad thing?  That’s really up to you to decide.  On the one hand, we elect the legislative branch to work as a team to create the laws, not single judges.  Judges are meant to make the laws function, not materially change what they mean.  But can a judge in good conscience continually interpret a law in a way that repeats the mistake that a judge made decades before?  Or continue interpreting a law in a way that doesn’t make sense any more since the world around it has changed?\r\n ','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(36,'Jobs-Economy','When thinking about jobs and the economy in general, it’s important to realize that there are things that the government can do that work for short term goals and things that work for long term goals.

We like to believe that justice is blind and judges are completely impartial.  But they are human beings, so they are more passionate about some things than other things.  If the public believes that they are impartial, then it becomes easier to do their job.  If it is public knowledge that a certain judge has a particular prejudice, then someone losing a case could claim that they did not receive justice and the judge’s ruling could be overturned.  The whole trial would have to start all over with a new judge.\r\n \r\n \r\n A lot of judges are either guided or bound by the code of Conduct of United States Judges.  http://www.uscourts.gov/RulesAndPolicies/CodesOfConduct/CodeConductUnitedStatesJudges.aspx\r\n Canon 5 of this document says they should refrain from political activity.  Judges can interpret this a number of ways and may act accordingly.  We at VoteWise believe the spirit of the code of ethics is to prevent judges from influencing the creation of laws.  Their job is to rule on laws already in existence. For this reason, they are not allowed to get up on a podium and endorse candidates but they can be on the board of trustees of non-profits that encourage certain behavior.  The rules do not explicitly say which type of non-profit, but VoteWise would interpret this to mean 501(3)c’s which may endorse something like saving the whales, but not specific legislation that would save the whales.\r\n \r\n In Canon 4 of this document, they also include the idea that the judge should not be so outspoken as to create prejudice.  If, for example, a judge is part of a save the whales charity, he might not be impartial as a maritime law judge, but he would be fine as a family law judge.  In situations where the judge has an obvious prejudice towards one side or another, the judge is supposed to recuse himself and another judge is supposed to step in.  If he does not, then someone can appeal for a mistrial and the verdict can get thrown out and the trial would have to happen all over again with a new judge, doubling the cost of the process and making it harder for witnesses to remember things that happened a long time ago.  In small communities, there may not be enough judges to make switching judges possible.\r\n \r\n In the case of judges being appointed by politicians, many judges will refuse to answer questions about how they would rule in cases that they might be called to judge in the near future.  This is to avoid politicians packing the courts with judges to win cases for themselves or their friends.  But in the case of this website, where thousands of people of different interests are voting, the idea that their answer will result in currying favor to win a court case in the interest of one individual is ridiculous.  So they should feel safe to answer questions related to how they do their job.\r\n \r\n For these last couple reasons, some judges would rather just play it safe and not talk about anything.  But without knowing how they will perform their duty, it is impossible to make an informed decision on who to hire as a judge.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(38,'Judicial Election Rules','For a long time, people have debated whether judges should be appointed by government officials or if it would be better to have them be elected by the public.  There are advantages and disadvantages to both ways.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(39,'Justice','There are many different kinds of punishments that Judges can put in place:  fines, dividing property, protection orders, suspensions, forced rehab, jail time… Two judges may both decide the same way on the guilt of a criminal, but not agree on how best to deal with them.  Some will take into consideration the history of the criminal and try to figure out a specific way to stop the path they are headed down, while others prefer standardized punishments to prevent favoritism towards criminals who are good at pulling the wool over people’s eyes or simply for the reason that it allows justice to move more swiftly.\n Jails are not a perfect cure for our problems, but some jails are better than others at preparing inmates to have productive crime free life after they leave.\n \n Some judges are more harsh in their punishments than others. Some seek creative alternatives. Some try to fit the punishment to the criminal, the crime, or the practicality of jail space or other situational issues.\n \n For example, a criminal commits a non-violent drug crime. She is the sole breadwinner for the family. If she were to go to jail, she would lose her job and her kids would have to be split up and put into foster homes. These kids would end up being taken from their current school and end up in different school districts. They would fall behind in their studies, and their home life would be shattered. A judge has to look at the criminal and decide what is in the best interest for everyone involved. Is this woman a bad mother? Are the kids better off in foster homes? Does the woman need to have this horrible thing happen to her family in order for her to start seeing the path she is heading down? Or maybe what’s best is for the woman to be forced into drug rehab, with the risk of losing her family if she doesn’t pass weekly drug tests.\n \n In many courts, the Judge also decides the punishments in lawsuits and other cases. For example: How do a divorced couple manage custody of their children? How much do you reward a guy for getting cancer from on the job duties? Even in cases where the jury decides the punishment, a judge is allowed (in some areas) to decide that their punishment is unjust and needs to be changed.\n \n Judges have a lot of power, so it’s really important for you to understand what they plan on doing with that power.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(40,'Land','We only have one piece of real estate, so what we choose to do with it is important.

Some transmission lines are well over a hundred years old.   But some communities are better or worse.  With modern computers, TV’s and other electronic conveniences, America’s dependence on electricity is skyrocketing.  Insufficient power lines could mean brown outs or black outs.  Additionally, most of America’s electric grid is susceptible to solar flares (and EMP’s created by nuclear blasts high in the atmosphere).  If we have a huge solar flare, we could blow up transformers all across America.  There aren’t that many spare transformers and replacing them is labor intensive.  If the black-out is in only one region, then transformers could be shipped from other regions in a few weeks, but if it goes out all over America, we could be without power for over a year.  Chances of this are slim but exist.  Since electricity powers water pumps, fuel pumps, and just about everything else, this could mean millions of people would die from dehydration, starvation, disease, etc.. A solar flare of that size is one of those things like Katrina, the storm that took out New Orleans- Everyone knows it’s going to happen eventually, but it’s probably not going to happen on their watch. A smaller solar flare knocked out much of Quebec in 1989 for 9 hours. \r\n  \r\n There are a number of things that can be done that could prevent this disaster, but none of them are cheap.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(55,'Privacy','The Fourth Amendment says “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.”\r\n Since the birth of America, there has been a battle between public safety and privacy.  There are good arguments on either side.\r\n \r\n Many people find privacy to be a personal and precious thing.  Having someone rummage through their underwear drawer or reading their love letters would be a personal violation.  Other people feel that if anyone wants to look at them nude, it’s ok, so long as it has an extremely remote chance of preventing some unknown crime.  \r\n In totalitarian countries, people often feel that they can never fully express themselves because they don’t know who’s listening.  Inability to talk about one issue often spreads to fear of talking about anything personal until they reach the point where they are in a self-imposed mental prison.  Even in America, some people fear that if they speak ill of the government often enough, the government will take secret action against them behind their backs. \r\n \r\n On the other side, if the authorities have instant access to all available information, they can catch criminals before they commit further crimes and successfully prosecute the ones they catch.  For example:  Imagine someone kidnaps a little girl.  The GPS in the girl’s phone tells police where they are until the kidnapper discovers the phone and tosses it out the window.  Fortunately, they’ve gone through an EZPass lane before he did this, so co-relating the GPS and the EZPass data, they discover what car he’s driving in.  This car is found abandoned at a supermarket.  Going through credit card records, they discover that someone who was at the supermarket that day never ate junk food before, but after that they ate exclusively fast food, just like the kidnapper.  The police now know that there are two victims and they are now driving the second victim’s car.  Scanning through the perp’s Facebook page, they look through all his friends’ photos and find him in a bunch of pictures at a cabin in the woods in the general direction where he was headed before they lost him.  They now know where he is heading and who might be helping him or at least know more.\r\n ','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(56,'Profiling','“Profiling” is the practice of figuring out what the likely background of a criminal is in order to narrow your search and capture them.  For example, if there is a serial killer, the first thought would be “White single male loner with power and control issues.”  Authorities can then look to see if anyone under that description had access to the victim.  While the criminal doesn’t always fit profile, it’s a good starting point and often helps find criminals faster.  “Racial profiling” is the practice of targeting people of a certain race for special treatment often unrelated to a specific crime event. For example, the police may stop all middle-eastern people at an airport thinking that they might be a terrorist.  If a crime is committed by one group more than others, this may help reduce the work of law enforcement and help them capture criminals.  However, targeting a particular race turns them into targets.  The whole race feels like the authorities are out to get them.  Once they are the target of the police instead of their ally, they stop reporting crimes and providing helpful information.  And studies have shown that if you treat people like criminals, they start behaving like criminals.

We still haven’t developed a perfect solution.  There is the natural desire to cause pain to the criminal as vengeance for the pain they inflicted.  Another desire is to somehow cure them of their criminal intentions so they never do it again.  Oftentimes, the two desires come into direct conflict with each other. Some think that criminals are un-reformable and the best you can hope for is to stow them away somewhere so they can’t do harm for at least a little while.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(59,'Quality of Care','There is a lot that can be done to improve the quality of care but some of these are not necessarily in the health industry’s best financial interest. They are not evil people, but in order to stay in business, companies need to look at what product will bring them the most profit. Oftentimes this means ignoring products or procedures that can improve the quality of care but have little or no room for profit. For things that might benefit us all but don’t follow the traditional capitalist goals, we need to decide if it makes sense to seek help from outside sources/regulatory offices. Below are some of these examples:\r\n \r\n Once a procedure or medicine has been approved there is almost no tracking to see how effective it is in the real world. If a procedure becomes common-place, then it is often approved for use on things it was not originally intended. Consequently, we have a lot of medicines, surgeries and other procedures that work great for a small minority of people but are used ineffectively on thousands of others. This is at best an unnecessary expense and at worst putting patients’ lives at risk.

So monocultures require more pesticides than intermingled crops do.\r\n \r\n As technology for pesticides and medicine get better, we are discovering that some pesticides affect humans directly or kill other things in the food web necessary for a functioning ecosystem.  As these detrimental effects are discovered, pesticides get replaced with new ones that science at the time believes to be less harmful.  But sometimes it takes decades to discover a danger and sometimes risk assessment means people know that they are putting things on the fields that are toxic, but the amount of toxicity is worth the added amount of food grown.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(63,'Sewage System','In 2013, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave our nation’s sewer systems a D, but some regions are better and some are worse.

The easiest way for a kid to find a niche in this situation is to try to be the center of attention. Army brat syndrome.

The first vote (The Primary Election) gets rid of the candidates you definitely don’t want so you can take a closer look at the remaining ones.  Months later, you have a second vote (The General Election), to pick the best candidate from the remaining crowd.  \r\n  \r\n Why is this necessary?  Why don’t we have just one vote? If you have too many similar people running for office, they will split the vote and none of them will win.  Let’s pretend for example that you live in a district where 85% of the voters are Republicans.  Without primaries, you might have ten Republicans and one Communist running for office.  Each Republican might win 8% of the vote while the Communist wins the election with only 12% of the votes. \r\n \r\n So there are two ways to hold primaries:  The Standard primary, and the Open Primary.\r\n In a Standard Primary, voters are separated by party and they are only allowed to vote for candidates in their own party.  This means that each party gets one candidate in the General Election. One disadvantage of this system is that the best person to bridge the gap between the parties probably wouldn’t win their party’s primary.  This makes it difficult for voters to find someone they all like.\r\n In an Open Primary, voters can vote for anyone they want, regardless of political party.  Usually, the top two candidates go on to the General Election.  One advantage of this is that someone who is able to bridge the gaps between the parties stands a better chance.  One disadvantage is that you could be repeating the same problem as no primary at all where you split the vote and the people who win are the candidates who few voters actually wanted.  \r\n \r\n Third party candidates do better with the Open Primary system.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(68,'Standardized Tests','Standardized tests are used by schools to assess their students and they are used by governments to assess schools.

They believed this land was given to them by God. But as happens to all great nations, war eventually tore it apart. Many tried since then to wipe the Jews off the face of the Earth, but they survived in pockets all over. Two thousand years ago, during the reign of the Roman Empire, the Jewish faith was split. Some became Christian, while other remained Jewish. Six hundred years later, Muhammed started Islam, a religion that sees its roots in the Jewish and Christian faiths. Mohamed was both a religious and military leader. Unlike many of the leaders of his time, he was relatively benign to the people he conquered. His empire and message spread and he brought together much of the Middle East. When he died, there was some question as to who should follow in his footsteps. Eventually, this caused a rift and Islam was split into two factions - Shia and Sunni.\r\n \r\n For a time, the Middle East was the center of the world for culture, science and mathematics. The Mongols and others invaded Europe and the Middle East from the Far East. Every large city was a target.  Both the Roman Empire and the cultural centers of the Middle East collapsed and were looted. Centuries later, the Europeans became Christian, formed kingdom nations, and then invaded the Middle East to seize back \"the Holy Land.\" (The Crusades) The Europeans lost but did a lot of damage along the way.\r\n \r\n Skip forward a few hundred years. WWII. The Jews were still a target for eradication, but no one would take the refugees fleeing from Germany because the world was still prejudiced against them. After the war, while the spoils were being split amongst the victors, the Jews asked for a place where they could have safe haven. They wanted the land that they believed God gave them- the area around Jerusalem. The area around Jerusalem was a desert not judged as all that valuable economically or tactically, and the western world was just as prejudice against the Arabs living there. So, they gave the Jews the land already populated by a number of Arabs. Money flooded in from the four corners of the Earth to support this new country. Non-Israeli Jews donated to support the promised land. Many Fundamentalist Christians poured money in because they believe that it is prophesized that the Jews will be in charge of the Holy Land when Jesus returns - and they want to rush that along. Keep in mind that the holiest of locations for the Moslem is the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. The original charter did not include the Dome of the Rock, but did include the remnants of the wall of the second Jewish temple (on which the Dome of the Rock was built).\r\n \r\n In 1967, Israel was invaded by the combined forces of a number of Moslem nations. The Israeli fought back and expanded their borders. These became \"the disputed territories\" of the Gaza Strip, The Golan Heights and the rest of Jerusalem including the Dome of the Rock. The Golan Heights has a strategic interest because it is an elevated area from which attacks (against Israel) could be launched.\r\n \r\n In the meantime, it became apparent that the Middle East was rich with oil, so the West became interested in the region. In order to gain the loyalty of these nations, the West put minorities in power. The leaders then dared not say \"no\" to the West because they knew they had no local support and would soon fall without Western interference. Having been oppressed minorities in the past, they then became unjust to the majority who had been cruel to them in the past.\r\n \r\n The people of these nations had previously been poor farmers and traders but many became millionaires overnight. Like people who win the lottery, these stories often didn’t end in a healthy way.\r\n In the 70’s, a number of these oil countries got together to try to get some autonomy. They created an oil trading organization called OPEC, which established stable prices and production limits for oil exports. Since they were no longer competing with each other, they could ask for more money per gallon of oil. The West tried to break this up in a number of ways, including buddying up with nations that they thought they could sway away from OPEC like Kuwait.\r\n \r\n At the same time, The USSR and the USA fought a proxy war in Afghanistan. Afghanistan didn’t have much to offer other than it had the possibility of being a strip of land to build an oil pipeline across. The USA trained and supported numerous local warlords including Osama Bin Laden. The Russians eventually decided it wasn’t worth the losses they were suffering and left. The USA bought back many of the weapons we supplied but didn’t help them rebuild their nation. Civil war broke out and the most powerful and vicious warlords seized control - the Taliban. The country fell back into the dark ages.\r\n \r\n We also often supported leaders that we saw as the lesser of two evils. But that still meant supporting someone who wasn’t great for local interests or even for our own. But if your only choices are dealing with an angry dictator or a terrorist... you choose the angry dictator.\r\n \r\n A lot of people ended up getting upset that we were playing with the governments and economies of these nations for our own personal financial gain at the cost of many of their people getting killed or tortured by dictators that we either put in power directly or indirectly. They also didn’t like how we supported Israel, the nation that took over their most holy region. So, problems arose.\r\n \r\n As it became unpopular for the leaders of the Arab nations to be seen as the puppets of the West, they had to play a balancing act - staying on the good side of the West, while at the same time, being seen as not. Supporting democracy and trying to stay in dictatorial roles. They also had to appear to the West to be in control of the many ethnic factions ruling small pockets of their countries, while in fact, they only had control over the major cities.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(78,'The Undeveloped Third World','Brief History- Historically, many of the peoples in these lands were nomadic or small community farmers and collected in smaller ethnic groups rather than larger nations. But over the centuries, the Western and stronger Asian nations invaded and created artificial boundaries that split some tribes apart and forced enemies to live with each other. It’s a lot easier for a foreign power to deal with one person rather than many warring factions, so they would draw lines in a map and declare one area Nation A and another area Nation B. The people living there didn’t have a choice. To keep these boundaries, these foreign nations would first use their own forces to enforce them and then back away leaving a puppet government there to keep the peace. In much of the world, racism continued to separate the historic opponents even though they shared the same foreign imposed national borders. Even hundreds of years later, many feel a stronger connection to their ethnic brethren than their countrymen. The Spanish did a better job of encouraging intermixing, so South and Central America are not as dramatically divided (though significant divides do still exist.)\r\n \r\n Generally speaking, if a nation has only one export - and that export is not a unique one, then their economy is very fragile. One poor nation will find ways of paying their people even less to produce coffee than their competitor. Many of the locals will find living off of slave wages preferable to living off the increasingly smaller jungles. Too often, local food farming declines in favor of producing the export. They can sell the export to get western goods like medicine and clothing, while if they were to just produce food, they would be in a similar situation as they were a hundred years ago with no fuel for tractors or high output fertilizers. If they produce enough foreign trade, they can buy foreign grown food and things that improve their quality and length of life. But as soon as another nation produces more or at a cheaper rate, then the value of that export declines and no one can afford anything - including food. This creates desperate situations. Desperate situations cause violence and political instability.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(79,'Third Trimester Abortions','“Late term abortions” are abortions that happen in the third trimester.  These are extremely rare and are usually only done in the case of severe birth defect or other extreme circumstances.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(80,'Tort Reform','One of the great defenses against injustice in America is the ability to sue people who do you wrong. Unfortunately, this ability to seek justice has undesirable side effects. There have been so many law suits against doctors for so much money that doctors and hospitals are paying enormous sums of money for malpractice insurance. Obstetricians are particularly heavily pounded with insurance rates that are often more than half their salary. Additionally, doctors in America have come to practice \"defensive medicine.\" This means that doctors are ordering tests and procedures that are unnecessary so that they can claim that they did everything possible if something goes wrong and they are sued. Besides the additional cost, sometimes these procedures actually put the patient at greater risk by putting them through unnecessary surgeries, medications that have side effects, or simply delaying treatment while tests are run. Doctors often perform procedures that they know are flawed because the politics and paperwork haven’t caught up with the science to make the new procedures acceptable practice.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(81,'Torture','Torture has been used for thousands of years.  (ex.: The Spanish Inquisition, witch trials... ) People will say almost anything to stop the torture.  This results in false confessions but also sometimes true confessions.  Most of the time, the torture victim will not confess, but rather name names.  Believable lies are usually based somewhere in reality, so enemies, acquaintances, friends and relatives often get blamed.  Information acquired from torture is never reliable by itself, but may generate leads for further investigation.  Other interrogation tools that are tailored to the specific psychology of the captive are much more reliable and often get real results where torture does not.  But these techniques require more skill. History is filled with examples where an army would torture its prisoners.  Hearing this, the second army would think of the first army as inhumanly evil so they would feel justified in torturing THEIR prisoners.  The first army would hear of the horrors and ramp up the atrocities to the point where the tit for tat would escalate to a Hell on Earth for soldier and citizens alike.  Some truly horrendous things happened. The torture of one person would lead to the justification for the rape, torture and murder of hundreds and sometimes thousands more in the years and decades after. \r\n Eventually, with the invention of photography, the horrors of war were brought home.  People tired of war atrocities and wanted a return to civility so torture of soldiers and civilians was outlawed by the Geneva convention in 1929.  It was a way of stopping inhumanity and at the same time prevent their own citizens and soldiers from future harm. If you don’t think long term, though, torturing one person might lead to info that saves a hundred lives.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(82,'Two Party System','Right now, in our nation’s capital, we effectively have a two party system.  This is caused by a winner–take- all style of election where whoever wins the most votes –even if it’s less than half the votes, wins the election.  Most Americans identify themselves as either Democrat or Republican, so most voters know that voting for a third party candidate is potentially a wasted vote.  They end up voting for the lesser of two evils.  This means that people who don’t believe in what the Democrats and Republicans are doing get ignored and the two parties can continue business as usual without making any changes.  In many areas, the Democrats and Republicans have created rules making it more expensive and much harder for third party candidates to even get on the ballot.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(83,'Voting General','Throughout time, many of those in power have tried to stop anyone else from having their voices heard and risk losing that power.  When democracy started, only land owners could vote.  Then they opened it up to all white men.  Then minorities.  Then women.  But while the Federal laws gave people the right to vote, local officials put up other road blocks.  Some techniques to prevent people from voting included making it incredibly difficult for certain people to register, charging fees that poor people couldn’t afford, making polling places hard to get to, and many others. \r\n In order for democracy to work, we must ensure that everyone has not just the right, but the ABILITY to have their voice heard and to be counted accurately.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(84,'Water - General','As the world population grows and industrialization increases in every region, clean fresh water to supply all our drinking, farming and other needs is harder to find.

At some point, we have to look at our water use and think about long term goals.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(85,'Water Supply','While the quality of the water that comes out of our sinks in America is quite high, the pipes supplying them are aging.  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers (who rate America’s water as a D+), our nation has about 240,000 water main breaks a year because our pipes are over a hundred years old.  There are numerous problems with old pipes – corrosion and debris collect on the insides making it more difficult to pass water through.  Corrosion causes the walls to thin and become brittle and can prevent valves from closing and can cause water to leak.  Small leaks in unpopulated areas cost the consumer in lost product, but leaks in populated areas can slowly eat away at foundations of buildings causing neighborhoods and businesses to collapse into giant sink holes.  Small leaks often go unnoticed for years because they’re underground.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(86,'Wind','Wind has been used to power things for centuries.

For this reason, drug patents don’t last as long as other patents.  When a patent expires, other companies can use the same formula to manufacture generic versions of these drugs.  In order to keep their prices low, the generic companies often don’t have any excess manufacturing capacity.  So any time they gear up to make a new drug, they have to abandon making another drug.  Sometimes this means abandoning less expensive medicines that just as effective or abandoning medicines that treat fewer people.','2016-01-23 14:01:59',NULL,NULL,NULL),(88,'GMO\'\'s (Genetically modified Organisms)','Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO’s) are relatively new to farming.

An unmarried couple cannot benefit from their spouse’s health insurance, can’t visit them in critical care, and can’t do a million other things that married couples take for granted.   For example, if one mate works while the other builds and maintains the house and raises the kids, then if the breadwinner dies, the surviving spouse can be thrown out of the house and lose the social security that the dead spouse earned.

While others believe that the city, voted into office by the people, will better address the actual needs of those people instead of focusing on whatever will make the most profit.\r\nA private company’s goal is to make profit.  This means, that if they were to do the same job in the same way, they would have to charge the customers more.  To reduce costs, they often must fire experienced people and hire new people for lower wages, cut corners, or use substandard materials.\r\nGovernment run companies have to deal with structures put in place by politicians.  This often means they have to continue following a bad rule put in place by someone years ago who was trying to look good for voters but wasn’t thinking long term.
